# Heart-Disease-Classification
* This project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
* In the NoteBook you will find a complete roadmap of a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer
* Recommendation: USE Jupyter in order to better understand the concept
